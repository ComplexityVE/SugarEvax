# Taxation and Evolution in Sugarscape
### By Vicky McDermott and Emily Lepert

## Abstract
We replicated the work done in the paper by implementing taxation and evolution
systems in our sugarscape model. With the same parameters used in the paper and
a few tweaks to our model we were able to see results that were qualitatively
similar to the ones in the paper. We then extended on the work they had done
by experimenting with what would happen when the welfare given out from the
collected taxes was given in proportional amounts to agents with varying amounts
of sugar instead of just splitting up the welfare sugar equally between all
agents. We found that the population as a whole does just about the same or even
better when the welfare sugar is divided equally as opposed to when different
percentages of it are given to different wealth brackets.
