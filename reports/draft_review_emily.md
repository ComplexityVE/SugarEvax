# [Project Review](https://github.com/ericasaywhat/SmoothCriminals/blob/master/reports/draft_final_report.md)
#### By Emily Lepert

#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
I don't know what the question is. From context I can infer what it might be, but it isn't explicitly stated. I understand what you're modeling but the question or what you are replicating exactly isn't made clear. From my understanding, you are seeing if an increase in interactions between offenders, police, and targets also increases crime rate.

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
I understand how an offender decides on whether or not to commit a crime. I'm a little confused about how you went from having nodes, to a grid of cells. It might be worth talking about how nodes are connected and how agents move from one node to another.

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
The results talk about "time away from home." I'm assuming that you'll talk about it in your interpretation, but you should also talk about what that means before you even show the graph. Graphs make sense and they are all labeled.

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
Not applicable.

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper? 
You don't show any of the original paper's graphs so I can't tell if the replication was successful.

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The extension makes a lot of sense and is interesting. 

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
It seems like the team is where they should be at. The interpretation of the replication section wasn't written up, so it's difficult to say how well the replication is going, but it seems like you know what you're doing. The extension seems very interesting and not out of scope (from my limited knowledge).

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?
Presentation is nice. There's a good description as to what terms mean and a good explanation for how agents interact. There are no violations from what I can tell.

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 
Yes to all of these.
