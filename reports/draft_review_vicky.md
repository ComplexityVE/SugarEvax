# Draft Review of Simulation of Smooth Modeling: agent based modeling of street crime

### Vicky McDermott

## Question:
### What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
My understanding of the experiment the team is replicating is an agent based system where agents choose whether or not to commit crimes by looking into a variety of factors including the presence of police or guardians. They use these factors to decide whether or not they should commit a crime in the next time step. I am not entirely sure what question the replicated paper was answering or what "time away from home" represents in the replicated graph. I would like to see a bit more explanation of this part of the replication. I really like the chart which demonstrates the agent's decision to offend but I would like even a little bit more explanation of how the suitability of a target is determined.

## Methodology:
### Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
The methodology does seem to make sense for the question of investigating crime rates with varying starting conditions. I really like the explanation and chart showing an agent's decision to offend.

## Results:
### Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
The visualizations are effective but could use a bit more explanation in the text section. The graphs all have descriptive axes labels except for the figure 2 graphs which could use labels and descriptions, but I think that portion is still in progress.

## Interpretation:
### Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
The draft report lays out the results and figures but does not yet have much interpretation to the question or explanation of what these graphs are showing me. I think adding some of this interpretation will make the report more powerful and will help me to understand better what question about crime rates the paper is really addressing.

## Replication:
### Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the
The report specifies that their results are consistent with the results from the original paper but I do not see any graphs from the original paper that are compared to their graphs. If such graphs exist I think it might be nice to include some alongside some of your graphs.

## Extension:
### Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The report explains an extension involving investigating the introduction of punishment into CrimeWorld. I think this definitely has the potential to answer some interesting questions about the effects of punishment on crime rates in society. Why do you think punishment in CrimeWorld will lead to higher crime rates? This is a very interesting result, if true, and I realize you are still working on generating more graphs and results, but I am curious about where this idea is even coming from. I can not tell from what you have written why you suspect that this will be the case.

## Progress:
### Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
It seems that the team is in a good place moving forward. They have mostly completed the replication and just need to add some interpretation to a few of their replicated graphs. Additionally, they need to finish the extension experiment with adding punishment to CrimeWorld. It seems like they have a solid plan and have completed roughly the correct amount for this point in the project.

## Presentation:
### Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?
The report is well written in a concise and correct language. I think it is consistent with the audience and goals of the report but could use some further explanation and description of the interpretation and question the experiment is trying to answer.

## Mechanics:
### Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
The file name is correct and the Markdown formatting looks good to me. I like the title and the authors' names are included. The bibliography format looks good to me.
